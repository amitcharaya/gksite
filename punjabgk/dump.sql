The famine is estimated to have caused the deaths of about 10 million people, and Warren Hastings’s 1772 report estimated that a third of the population in the affected region starved to death.[3] Rajat Datta estimates a much lower revised number, in the range of around 2 million dead within 6–7 months.\n\nThe famine is one of the many famines and famine-triggered epidemics that devastated the Indian subcontinent during the 18th and 19th century.[5][6][7] It is usually attributed to a combination of weather and the policies of the East India Company. The start of the famine has been attributed to a failed monsoon in 1769 that caused widespread drought and two consecutive failed rice crops. The devastation from war, combined with exploitative tax revenue policies of the East India Company after 1765 crippled the economic resources of the rural population.\n\nNobel prize winning Indian economist Amartya Sen describes it as a man-made famine, noting that no previous famine had occurred in Bengal that century, and the region under the Muslim rule was one of the world\'s major economic power and signalled the advent of proto-industrialisation. Historian William Dalrymple held that the deindustrialisation of Bengal and the policies of the East India Company were the reasons for the mass famine and widespread chaos',1,3),(130,'Who among the following launched Sentinel-6 to monitor Oceans','2020-10-21 03:47:21.000000','France and China','Japan and Korea','USA and Euorpe','USA and U.K','USA and Euorpe','The Copernicus Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite, designed to monitor oceans, was launched from the Vandenberg Air Force base in California aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on November 21.\n\nThis is a part of the next mission dedicated to measuring changes in the global sea level.

The initiative, undertaken by Japan&rsquo;s<strong> Sumitomo Forestry company and Kyoto</strong> University, aims to combat the growing problem of space debris.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At present, the plan is said to be in the nascent stage, as several wooden materials are being tested by the research team to find the one most suitable for space missions. As per reports, the team is also working towards developing wooden materials that are extremely resistant to temperature changes and sunlight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the selection of the wood, the materials will be tested under extreme conditions here on Earth. In the subsequent stages, the engineering model will be developed, and then, work will begin on the final flight model. If all goes out as planned, the two teams will launch the first satellite in 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wooden satellites are considered good alternatives to traditional satellites, as they can get burnt easily while re-entering the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, thus leaving no harmful junk behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Takao Doi, a Japanese astronaut and a professor at the Kyoto University, told the BBC that all types of the satellites that re-enter the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere gets burnt and release tiny alumina particles. These particles are capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for several years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Growing space debris</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At present, satellites are being used for numerous applications like communication, television, navigation, disasters, and weather forecasting, among others. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), more than 6,000 satellites are currently orbiting the Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>The space junk problem was first observed in the 1960s, a</strong>nd it has taken a long time since for the world to come up with measures to get rid of it. According to <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2019/10/Distribution_of_space_debris_around_Earth\">ESA&#39;s statistical model</a>, there are more than <strong>130 million pieces</strong> of anthropogenic space debris&mdash;waste residue due to human activities&mdash;smaller than a millimetre around our planet. The debris can travel at a speed of more than <strong>22,300 mph</strong> and can impact other satellites.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a time when the pocket of space around Earth consisted of zero human-made objects. But then, following <strong>the launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957,</strong> everything changed. Now, we have hundreds of satellites in the near-Earth orbit, which remain active and continue to serve the world. However, this space also hosts all the useless, defunct satellites which, as of now, are vastly outnumbering the operational objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts have warned that the number of space debris floating in space is going to exponentially increase in the upcoming years. The <a href=\"https://www.sdo.esoc.esa.int/environment_report/Space_Environment_Report_latest.pdf\">latest annual report </a>from the European Space Agency (ESA) shows that the amount of space junk has been relentlessly increasing, despite the fact that various steps have been taken to curb this waste in recent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several space agencies, including<strong> NASA and ESA,</strong> are coming up with projects that could attempt to collect space debris in the future, with ESA planning to launch one such mission in 2025. While these appear to be curative measures, the project undertaken by Japan, being a preventive measure, seems to be a step in the right direction.</p>',1,3),(162,'which state rolls out \'Launch Pad Scheme\' to make youth self-reliant','2021-01-10 05:39:13.000000','Madhya Pradesh','Bihar','U.P','Gujrat','Madhya Pradesh','<table cellspacing=\"0\" id=\"ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_FormView1\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td colspan=\"2\">In Madhya Pradesh, &#39;Launch Pad Scheme&#39; is being started for boys and girls coming out of child care institutions and having completed 18 years of age.
